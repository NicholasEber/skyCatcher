The main reason for this flight is to analyze particles 
that are at the altitude of 100,000 feet or higher.

The Code is made in mind that controling the servo to open the lid and that all the 
sensors need to be loged in to a file.

Hardware we will plan to use:
Altitude sensor - This will be inside the payload, it will also be reading our internal temperature with it. 
Temp sensor 1 - This will go next to the lid motor, that way we can see what temperature it reaches and how the motor reacts. 
Temp sensor 2 - This will be on the outside of the payload, that way we can compare the outside to the 
                inside temperature, to continue the insulation testing from past payloads. While we have temperature 
                sensors, they are rated for -55 C, so we may have to buy one that can withstand colder temperatures to 
                get proper readings at altitudes. 
3 axis Accelerometer - It will be inside the payload, it will be useful to gather Data on the kinds of forces are experienced 
                       throughout the mission.
Lid servo - It will be outside the payload, insulated, used to open lid.
Lid closed check - A digital button, it will be pressed when the lid has completely closed, this will tell 
                   the lock servo to lock the lid ( in case it fails, a timer on the software side should be made)
Lid lock servo - On the side of the payload, will lock the lid in place once is has closed and we are descending
Linino one board - This is our main computer, we thought about swapping to a raspberry pi, but it did not have the 
                   required inputs and outside we needed.
